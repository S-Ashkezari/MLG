    "    \"Graphs are a powerful way to represent complex relationships between entities. In graph theory, a graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used in many real-world applications, including social networks, biological networks, recommendation systems, and more.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"### Why Graph Machine Learning?\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Traditional machine learning models expect input data to be in a tabular form, but many real-world problems involve relationships between entities, which are best represented as graphs. Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) is designed to leverage these relationships to improve predictive accuracy and discover hidden patterns.\"\n",

    "    \"- **Tabular Data**: Each row is an independent observation with fixed features (e.g., spreadsheets, CSV files).\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Graph Data**: Nodes (entities) are interconnected, and their relationships (edges) are crucial. The features of a node may depend on its neighbors in the graph.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"### Example\\n\",\n",
    "    \"In a social network, users are nodes, and friendships are edges. A user's behavior can be influenced by their friends, which demonstrates dependency between nodes, unlike in tabular data where each row is independent.\"\n",
